# Thermodynamic Cycles
Python code to construct thermodynamic cycles. Create several diagrams (T-s, h-s, P-v e.t.c.) and calculate state and processes variables such as temperature, entropy, work e.t.c.. Save all the above to .png and .csv files correspondingly. It works for the following working fluids:

- Ideal gas,

- Van der Walls gas and 

- Two Phase gas.

### Ideal gas.

Implementation of the ideal gas formulations for Isobaric, Isochoric and Isentropical processes.The others types of processes are to be made.

### Van der Walls gas.

Solving the Van der Walls equation numericaly using Newtons method. Works for Isobaric and Isothermal processes. The others types of processes are to be made.

### Two Phase gas.

Using @CoolProp library to calculate system variables. Works for Isobaric and Adiabatic processes. The others types of processes are to be made.

_Future improvements are to comment the code and make it work for all types of processes._
